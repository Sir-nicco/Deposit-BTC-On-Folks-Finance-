# Deposit-BTC-On-Folks-Finance-

Not sure about you, but from my side, I am making my $BTC assets work very hard on @FolksFinance. 

So hard it's earning 19,1% APY!

Nope, I do not own YBTC.B; I have $WBTC that I collateralise and use to borrow YBTC.B that I then deposit for this sweet APY 🤑

No need to change your assets into something else with @FolksFinance, you can just use any of them, deposit, and then borrow any other asset on any chain supported by Folks Finance xChain; that's the beauty of it.

Go have a look and see if you like it.
